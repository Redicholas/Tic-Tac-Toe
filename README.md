# Tic-Tac-Toe
This is a simple, fun, and interactive game of Tic-Tac-Toe, a classic game that is familiar to many. This project was developed for a school assignment using Vue.js, a modern and efficient JavaScript framework.

## Project Overview
The project is a web-based version of the classic game Tic-Tac-Toe. It allows two players to play against each other on the same device. The game alternates turns between the players, starting with Player 1, who is the 'X', and then Player 2, who is the 'O'. The player who places three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row first wins the game. If the board is filled and no player has won, it is a draw.
